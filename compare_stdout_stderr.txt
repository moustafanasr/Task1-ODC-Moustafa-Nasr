Standard Output (stdout) and Standard Error (stderr) are two separate output
streams in a program. stdout is used for regular,expected output, such as
results or data, and it has a file descriptor of 1.
On the other hand, stderr is used to report errors or warnings, 
with a file descriptor of 2.
The key difference between them is that stdout handles normal program output,
while stderr handles error messages, allowing them to be managed separately. 
This distinction helps in debugging and logging, as errors can be 
redirected without affecting normal output.
